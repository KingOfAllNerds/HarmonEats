A commission-less, tip-less solution for delivery driving.

Covid-19 has affected the world in many different ways. Restaurants were completely closed for some time and now there are strict mask and social distancing guidelines. Restaurants are relying on delivery for their main source of income. Many of these delivery companies though, like Uber Eats and GrubHub, have a few major flaws.

The restaurants are losing money because of the 15-30% commission on each order, the drivers are not making consistent money due to inconsistency of tips and the customers are paying more for each meal because of delivery fees and tips.

Considering the shortcomings of these delivery services, we came up with a go-to-market strategy that removes tips, delivery fees and commission from the equation.
